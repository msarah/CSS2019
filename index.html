    <h1>How to use git</h1>

    <p>git is a version control system - it tracks changes made to a filesystem over time. It is used very often by programmers to keep track of the software development process, especially with projects involving multiple teams. github was created as a
      website to allow visualization of what is happening with git, and sort of became a "facebook for programmers", allowing people to share their code easily with others. Using git and github together is a skill that is almost necessary in the world
      of programming today (it will also make your life much easier!). </p>

    <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
    <p>Once git is installed on your computer, you will need to create what is called a <em>repository.</em>
      <section>First, create a folder where you will be keeping your project. This will be your local repository. Next, you should add what is called a ".gitignore" file. This is a simple text file to tell git what files to ignore when we are submitting changes.
        This can be useful if you don't want to include certain resources like photos when making commits. You can add the ".gitignore" file either via the command line or by going to the folder through your file manager.</section>
    </p>

    <section>Next, we have to tell git that this is the folder you are using for your repository. We do this by using the command "git init" in the terminal while inside the folder (to check where you are use the command "pwd" - print working directory).</section>
