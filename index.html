    <h2>how do i use it</h2>
    <p>once git is installed on your computer, you will need to create what is called a <em>repository.</em> First, create a folder where you will be keeping your project. This will be your local repository. Next, we have to tell git that this is the folder
      you are using for your repository. We do this by using the command "git init" in the terminal while inside the folder (to check where you are use the command "pwd" - print working directory).
