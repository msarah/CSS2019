<!-- CSS specificity refers to the order and priority given to selectors on an element.
    elements/pseudo-elements            = +0001
    classes/pseudo-classes/attributes   = +0010
    id                                  = +0100
    inline elements                     = +1000

   using combinations of selectors (or compound selectors) requires calculation of specificity

   ORDER MATTERS: if you have two selectors of equal specificity on an element,
   the LAST SELECTOR rendered will be applied (CSS is rendered by the browser from
    TOP to BOTTOM)

  This also applies to HTML: when inserting linked stylesheets, the order in which they are placed matters.
  For this reason it is important to apply resets FIRST, then any other styling after the page has been reset-->

<body>

  <h1 class="h-class" id="h-id">the id color will be applied as it has a specificity of 100, as compared to a specificity of 10 on the class selector</h1>
  <!-- the font-weight and font-size properties are still applied to the h1 tag because the class/id selectors are not trying to effect these properties -->

  <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">link to google</a>
  <!-- color will be resolved to BLUE because attributes have a higher specificity than element selectors -->
</body>
